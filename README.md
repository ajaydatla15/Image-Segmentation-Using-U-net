## Project Overview  
This project focuses on **image segmentation** of **battery electrode microstructure images** using a **U-Net deep learning model**. The objective is to accurately identify and segment four key components of the battery material:  

âœ… **Pore**  
âœ… **Silicon**  
âœ… **Conductive Binder Domain (CBD)**  
âœ… **Graphite**  

By leveraging **deep learning techniques**, this project enhances **material characterization, battery research, and performance analysis**.  

## Dataset & Preprocessing  
- **Battery microstructure images** were used as the primary dataset.  
- Applied **image normalization and augmentation** (rotation, flipping, contrast adjustments) to improve model generalization.  

## Model Architecture  
The project utilizes a **U-Net-based convolutional neural network (CNN)** with:  
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture** with **skip connections** for high-precision segmentation.  
- **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) + Dice Loss** for optimal pixel-wise classification.  
- **Batch normalization & dropout** for stability and better generalization.  

## Results & Performance
