# Image Segmentation using U-net
Battery Composition Segmentation using U-Net 🔋🧪

Overview

This project focuses on image segmentation of battery electrode microstructure images using a U-Net deep learning model. The goal is to accurately identify and segment four key components of the battery material:

✅ Pore
✅ Silicon
✅ Conductive Binder Domain (CBD)
✅ Graphite

By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project enhances material characterization, battery research, and performance analysis.

Dataset & Preprocessing
	•	Battery microstructure images were used as the primary dataset.
	•	Applied image normalization and augmentation (rotation, flipping, contrast adjustments) to improve model generalization.

Model Architecture

The project utilizes a U-Net-based convolutional neural network (CNN) with:
	•	Encoder-Decoder Architecture with skip connections for high-precision segmentation.
	•	Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) + Dice Loss for optimal pixel-wise classification.
	•	Batch normalization & dropout for stability.

Results & Performance

✅ Successfully segmented all four elements from battery microstructure images.
✅ Achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 80% for accurate element differentiation.
✅ Enabled deeper analysis of battery material distribution and structural composition.

Technologies Used
